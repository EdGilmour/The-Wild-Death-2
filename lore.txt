The Divided States of America began as the United States of America. Shortly after gaining their independence from Britian, a civil war was sparked over slavery. Other factors played a role, but that was the "official" reason. Both sides didn't really have the manpower or will to actually continue the war, so a truce was reached soon. The new nation, although tired by the years of fighting, stayed a singular nation to deter external threats. However the south rejected the idea of a president and instead each state would send a representative to a council that would be the central government. This idea led to a weak central government with the democratic processes taking forever. Issues were slow to be resolved and generally state governments would solve problems first. Although originally known as the USA due to it's form of government it was often called the Divided States of America. Eventually DSA was adopted as it's officil name. Although the position of president was originally rejected it was implemented after the war of 1812 made the need for an executive head obvious.
